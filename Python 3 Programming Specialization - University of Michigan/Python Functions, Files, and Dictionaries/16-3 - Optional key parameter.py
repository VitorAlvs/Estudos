#You will be sorting the following list by each element’s second letter, a to z. Create a function to use when sorting, called second_let. It will take a string as input and return the second letter of that string. Then sort the list, create a variable called sorted_by_second_let and assign the sorted list to it. Do not use lambda.

#Below, we have provided a list of strings called nums. Write a function called last_char that takes a string as input, and returns only its last character. Use this function to sort the list nums by the last digit of each number, from highest to lowest, and save this as a new list called nums_sorted.
